Problem: Galactic Arithmetic

In a far-off galaxy named Arithmetica beings have been using a newly discovered
number system to make their life easier.However, they are facing difficulties in 
performing basic arithmetic operations.As a resident genius of planet earth, you have
been callrd upon to help them.Your first task is to build a function that will be able
 to add two numbers in their number system.
 
 Function:
 public static long galacticAddition(long num1,long num2);
 
 Inputs:
 The function galacticAddition(long num1,long num2); will receive two parameters:
   1.num1: a long integer representing the first number in the Arithmetiica number system
   2.num2: a long integer representing the second number in the Arithmetica number system.
   
   
 Outputs:
 The function will return a long - the sum of num1 and num2 in the Arithmetica 
 number system
 
 
 Sample input:
 125678
 9876543210
 
 Sample Output:
 9876668888
 
 Note:
 In the sample input, the two numbers provided to the function are 125678
  9876543210.The sum of these two numbers is  9876543210, so the functions 
  retuns  9876543210 as the output.Your task is to help the beings of Arithmetic perform this 
  basic operation with ease.
